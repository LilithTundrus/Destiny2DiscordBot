# Destiny2DiscordBot

This project is in Alpha. Please stand by...

Keep in mind the D2 API is very complicated and yet to be finished. 


Current working features are as follows:

* SearchPlayer - Bot can search for a player on Battle.net by their Battle Tag
* Profile - Get a player's most recently played D2 character by their Battle Tag
* Item - Get a D2 weapon/armor item by name (PAGINATION NOT YET WORKING!!!)
* Nightfall - Get the weekly Nightfall info (sometimes is classified)
